# hello-world
I’m a Brazilian engaged in sustainable trends to face our socioeconomic challenges.
I’ve been conducting collaborative investigations toward technoscienctific contributions to support the community and industry.

I have been privileged in living different experiences. Although circumstances from native conditions and events from some choices, I could find them like opportunities and teachings.
I received useful insights working as a technician, entrepreneur or server in the industry, commerce or state. Such helpful perspectives led me to develop functional competences.
Since adolescence, I study and practice music, growing my discipline to build skills gradually. Physical training and healthy nutrition are regular in a proactive routine for daily issues.

I  hope to cooperate to reach innovative solutions by aiding society to help people in different nations around the world...
